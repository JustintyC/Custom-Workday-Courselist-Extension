# Note
- Workday only renders 50 sections at once, and the extension can only see the sections Workday has rendered. If the table is incomplete, please scroll to the bottom of the page to force Workday to render more sections.
- Many multi-term courses are not displayed correctly since Workday does not properly indicate which courses span multiple terms in its original layout. To confirm the length of a course, please press the (i) button for any of its sections and verify their start/end dates.
- Some courses are placed under the "Unspecified" term. This is a result of Workday not providing start/end dates properly in its original layout. Please check the start/end dates of such courses by pressing the (i) button for any of its sections.
